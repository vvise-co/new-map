# ===========================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Vite)
# ===========================================
# For local development. In production, set VITE_AUTH_SERVER_URL as a build argument.

# Auth server URL - where users authenticate (NOT this app's URL!)
# This should be the URL of your central auth server
# Example: http://localhost:8081 (local) or https://auth-server-xyz.koyeb.app (production)
VITE_AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8081

# ===========================================
# KOYEB DEPLOYMENT
# ===========================================
# When deploying to Koyeb, set VITE_AUTH_SERVER_URL as a BUILD ARGUMENT (not env var):
#
# Build Arguments:
#   VITE_AUTH_SERVER_URL = https://your-auth-server.koyeb.app
#
# This is needed because Vite bakes environment variables into the build at compile time.
